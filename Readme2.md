Airline Data Analysis & Visualization Project
Welcome to the Airline Data Analysis project.

This project delivers an in-depth examination of airline operations using a structured dataset containing passenger and flight details. The focus is on generating actionable business insights through clean data storytelling, smart chart selection, and interactive visualizations that make the findings more engaging and easier to interpret.

Overview
The aviation sector produces enormous volumes of data through its daily activities. This project taps into that data to uncover:

Trends in passenger demographics and travel behavior

Patterns and potential causes behind flight delays and cancellations

Insights into pilot workload and reliability

Geographic trends in flight routes across countries and continents

The core aim is to derive strategic insights that could support airline operations and decision-making through detailed analysis and interactive visuals.

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project, titled Airline Dataset1.csv, contains 15 structured columns with detailed information on passengers, airports, pilots, and flights:

Column Name	Description
Passenger ID	Unique identifier for each passenger
First Name, Last Name	Full name of the passenger
Gender, Age, Nationality	Demographic details
Airport Name, Country, Continent	Flight departure location
Departure Date	Date the flight was scheduled
Arrival Airport	Destination of the flight
Pilot Name	Name of the assigned pilot
Flight Status	Flight outcome: On Time, Delayed, or Cancelled

Project Objectives
Source, clean, and validate real-world airline data

Create new features to support deeper analysis

Perform descriptive and diagnostic analytics

Build meaningful and interactive visualizations

Present clear, narrative-driven insights

Data Preparation & Cleaning
Checked for and removed missing or incomplete records

Converted date fields into proper datetime format

Eliminated duplicates and standardized labels for consistency

Feature Engineering
Counted total flights and delay rates per pilot

Extracted day of the week and month from flight dates

Grouped data by region and nationality for regional analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Passenger Demographics
Breakdown of age by gender

Nationality analysis across continents

Flight Operations
Comparison of on-time vs delayed/cancelled flights

Daily and monthly trends in flight volume

Pilot Analysis
On-time performance tracked per pilot

Identification of the most and least active pilots

Geographic Trends
Busiest countries and continents for departures

Frequent route patterns and hubs

Interactive Visualizations
Chart Type	Purpose	Features
Pie Chart	Distribution of flight statuses	Hover tooltips, percent labels
Histogram	Age distribution segmented by gender	Filters, density overlays
Time Series Line	Flight trends over time	Zoom, range sliders
Grouped Bar Chart	Top 15 pilots ranked by delay/on-time performance	Color legends, tooltips
Treemap	Nationalities grouped by continent	Zoom and drill-down
Scatter Plot	Passenger age versus flight date by status	Tooltip and zoom
Box Plot	Age spread by gender and flight outcome	Highlight outliers

Insights and Observations
Delays tend to be more frequent in certain regions, potentially linked to infrastructure or weather conditions

Older passengers appear to experience slightly more delays and cancellations

Some pilots are flying significantly more than others, which could indicate potential fatigue

Most international flights originate from a small number of hub airports, mainly located in North America and Europe

A notable increase in flight volume is observed on weekends, likely due to leisure travel demand
