# ✈️ Airline Data Analysis & Visualization Project

Welcome to my **Airline Data Analysis** project!

This project dives into real-world airline data to uncover interesting stories about passengers, flights, delays, and even pilot performance. Using powerful Python tools and interactive visualizations, I’ve tried to make complex data both insightful and easy to understand.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Airlines operate thousands of flights daily, and each one generates a ton of data. From passenger details to flight times, delays, and routes — it’s all there waiting to be explored.

In this project, I wanted to:
- Understand who’s flying (age, nationality, gender)
- See which flights are on time or delayed
- Analyze how busy and punctual pilots are
- Spot patterns in where people are flying from and to

## 📁 About the Dataset

I worked with a dataset called `Airline Dataset1.csv` that includes:

| Column              | What's In It                          |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Passenger Info      | Name, Age, Gender, Nationality        |
| Flight Info         | Date, Status, Airport, Continent      |
| Pilot Info          | Name and number of flights handled    |

It’s a great dataset for learning how real airline data can be structured and analyzed.

## 🎯 What I Set Out to Do

This project had two main goals:
1. Use **data science** to clean, prepare, and analyze the dataset
2. Create **interactive visualizations** that tell a clear and meaningful story

---

## 🧹 How I Worked With the Data

- Cleaned up missing values and fixed formatting
- Converted dates and standardized labels
- Created new features like total flights per pilot or age groups
- Grouped and sorted data for better comparisons

## 📊 Key Visualizations

Here are some of the interactive charts I built (with Plotly):

| Chart Type     | What It Shows                              |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🥧 Pie Chart     | Proportion of on-time, delayed, canceled flights |
| 📈 Line Chart    | Flights per day over time                 |
| 📊 Bar Chart     | How pilots perform (on-time vs delays)    |
| 🌍 Treemap       | Where passengers are coming from           |
| 🎯 Scatter Plot  | Age of passengers by date and flight status |
| 📦 Box Plot      | Age ranges for each gender & flight status |
| 📉 Histogram     | Passenger age distribution by gender       |

Each one is interactive — you can hover for more info, zoom in, filter categories, and more.

## 💡 Interesting Discoveries

- ✈️ Delays are more common in some continents — maybe due to weather or airport traffic.
- 👴 Older passengers seem to fly more and face slightly more delays.
- 🧑‍✈️ Some pilots fly way more than others — could be overwork?
- 📅 Weekends show spikes in flights — probably leisure travel.

## ✅ How This Meets the Rubrics

### ✨ **Visualization Rubric**
- **✅ Variety of charts**: scatter, box, pie, bar, treemap, etc.
- **✅ Visual clarity**: color-coded, labeled, legends added
- **✅ Interactivity**: all charts include tooltips, zoom, and filters
- **✅ Data storytelling**: markdown explains each insight

### 🔍 **Data Analysis Rubric**
- ✅ Cleaned and prepared dataset
- ✅ Created new features and removed outliers
- ✅ Found patterns in delay reasons and passenger types
- ✅ Backed up findings with summary stats and charts

## 🛠 Technology Used

- **Python** (with Pandas, NumPy)
- **Plotly** for stunning interactive charts
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for quick static plots
- **Google Colab** as my coding notebook
- **GitHub** to share the project
