# Airline Data Analysis & Visualization Project

Welcome to the **Airline Data Analysis** project!  
This project presents a detailed analysis and interactive visualization of airline operations using a structured passenger and flight dataset. We focus on generating business-relevant insights through effective data storytelling, thoughtful chart selection, and interactive visuals.

---

# Overview

The aviation industry generates massive data from daily operations. This project utilizes such data to explore:

- Passenger demographics and flight behavior
- Causes and patterns of flight delays and cancellations
- Pilot workload and reliability
- Travel trends by country and continent

The goal is to generate strategic insights for airlines using **interactive visualizations and rich analysis**.

# Dataset Description

The dataset `Airline Dataset1.csv` includes 15 columns capturing passenger, airport, pilot, and flight details:

| Column Name            | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Passenger ID           | Unique identifier for each passenger |
| First Name, Last Name  | Passenger's full name |
| Gender, Age, Nationality | Demographic info |
| Airport Name, Country, Continent | Departure location |
| Departure Date         | Date of flight departure |
| Arrival Airport        | Destination airport |
| Pilot Name             | Assigned pilot |
| Flight Status          | On Time, Delayed, or Cancelled |

 # Project Objectives

1. Source, clean, and validate a real-world dataset
2. Engineer features for insightful analytics
3. Perform descriptive and diagnostic analysis
4. Visualize key trends interactively
5. Communicate findings through compelling data storytelling

---

# Data Preparation & Cleaning

- Checked and removed missing values (e.g., names, flight status)
- Converted `Departure Date` to datetime format
- Removed duplicates and standardized categorical values (e.g., flight status labels)

---

# Feature Engineering

- Aggregated pilot flight counts and delay ratios
- Extracted day-of-week/month from `Departure Date`
- Grouped by continent and nationality for geo-insights

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Insights and Observations

-  **Delays are more common** in specific continents, likely due to infrastructure or weather issues.
-  **Older passengers** tend to have a slightly higher delay/cancellation rate.
-  **Some pilots are overburdened**, impacting punctuality.
-  **Most flights depart from a small number of hub airports**, mostly located in North America and Europe.
-  **Flight volumes spike on weekends**, indicating leisure travel peaks.
