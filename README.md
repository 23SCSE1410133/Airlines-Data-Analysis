## üîç Overview

The aviation industry generates a massive amount of data daily. This project utilizes such data to:

- Understand who the airline passengers are
- Evaluate pilot workloads and punctuality
- Examine flight disruptions and their causes
- Analyze geographical flight trends
- Deliver insights for strategic improvements in airline operations

## üìÅ Dataset Description

The dataset (`Airline Dataset1.csv`) contains rich details of flights, passengers, airports, and pilots. It includes the following columns:

| Column Name             | Description                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Passenger ID`          | Unique ID assigned to each passenger                       |
| `First Name`            | First name of the passenger                                |
| `Last Name`             | Last name of the passenger                                 |
| `Gender`                | Gender of the passenger                                    |
| `Age`                   | Age of the passenger                                       |
| `Nationality`           | Nationality of the passenger                               |
| `Airport Name`          | Name of the airport from which the passenger boarded       |
| `Airport Country code`  | Country code of the departure airport                      |
| `Country Name`          | Name of the country the airport is located in              |
| `Airport Continent`     | Continent of the airport                                   |
| `Continents`            | Route continents involved in the flight                    |
| `Departure Date`        | Date of flight departure                                   |
| `Arrival Airport`       | Destination airport                                        |
| `Pilot Name`            | Name of the pilot assigned to the flight                   |
| `Flight Status`         | Status of the flight (on-time, delayed, or canceled)       |

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goals of this project include:

- Conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on airline operations
- Analyzing **passenger demographic** data based on age, gender, and nationality
- Understanding **flight punctuality** and causes of delays/cancellations
- Evaluating **pilot workloads and efficiency**
- Identifying geographical **flight route patterns**
- Visualizing key trends for decision-makers and stakeholders

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

Key analytical and visual components in the notebook include:

- **Passenger Demographics**  
  - Age and gender distribution
  - Nationality distribution by continent

- **Flight Operations**
  - Flight status counts (on-time, delayed, canceled)
  - Departure frequency by airport and date
  - Trends in flight delays

- **Pilot Analysis**
  - Pilot performance based on flight status
  - Number of flights handled per pilot

- **Geographical Insights**
  - Most common departure/arrival countries
  - Route continent combinations

All analysis is supplemented with **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** visualizations.

## üí° Insights and Observations

Some of the notable insights from this analysis include:

- Delays are more frequent in certain continents, possibly due to weather or congestion.
- A few pilots are overburdened with many flights, which may impact performance.
- Certain airports are major hubs based on departure and arrival frequency.
- Passenger demographics are concentrated in specific age groups and nationalities.

These insights can be used by airline companies for operational improvements, resource allocation, and strategic planning.
