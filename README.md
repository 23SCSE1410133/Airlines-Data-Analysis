‚úàÔ∏è Airline Data Analysis


Welcome to the Airline Data Analysis project! This repository contains an in-depth exploration and analysis of global airline operations data, aiming to derive meaningful insights into passenger demographics, flight routes, pilot performance, and overall flight operations.

üìä Project Overview
The aviation industry heavily relies on data to ensure safety, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. This project leverages a rich dataset comprising diverse parameters from global airline operations to:

Understand trends in passenger behavior

Analyze flight punctuality and disruptions

Evaluate pilot performance metrics

Optimize travel routes and airport efficiency

Provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the aviation sector

üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple features that together offer a holistic view of airline operations. Below is a breakdown of the dataset columns:

Column Name	Description
Passenger ID   : 	Unique identifier for each passenger
First Name	   :  First name of the passenger
Last Name	     :  Last name of the passenger
Gender	       :  Gender of the passenger
Age	           :  Age of the passenger
Nationality	   :  Nationality of the passenger
Airport Name	 :  Name of the airport where the passenger boarded
Airport Country code :  Country code of the airport's location	          
Country Name   :	Name of the country the airport is located in
Airport Continent	: Continent where the airport is situated
Continents	 :    Continents involved in the flight route
Departure Date	: Date when the flight departed
Arrival Airport	: Destination airport of the flight
Pilot Name      : Name of the pilot operating the flight
Flight Status	  : Current status of the flight (e.g., on-time, delayed, canceled)

üß† Key Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover patterns and anomalies

Study demographic trends of passengers across countries and continents

Evaluate flight status trends to identify causes and patterns of delays/cancellations

Analyze pilot performance and workload through flight frequency and punctuality

Create visual dashboards to communicate insights effectively

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Google Colab

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
